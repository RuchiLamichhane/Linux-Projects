# Linux System Management Project

## Project Overview
Experience in managing and automating tasks on Linux systems, focusing on performance, security, and reliability.


### 1. System Administration
- **User Management:**
  - Created and managed user accounts and groups.
  - Implemented password policies and user permissions.
  - Automated user account creation and deletion using shell scripts.

- **File System Maintenance:**
  - Monitored disk space usage and optimized storage.
  - Configured and maintained file systems (e.g., ext4, XFS).

- **Network Configuration:**
  - Configured network interfaces and routing.
  - Managed network services (e.g., DNS, DHCP).
  - Implemented network security measures (e.g., IP tables).

### 2. Automation
- **Routine Task Automation:**
  - Developed shell scripts for daily system checks (e.g., disk usage, memory usage).
  - Automated system updates and patch management.
  - Scheduled automated backups using cron jobs.

- **Performance Monitoring:**
  - Created scripts to monitor system performance metrics.
  - Automated log rotation and archiving.

### 3. Security Management
- **Firewall Configuration:**
  - Configured and managed firewall rules using iptables and firewalld.
  - Implemented port security and traffic filtering.

- **Intrusion Detection Systems:**
  - Installed and configured intrusion detection systems (e.g., Snort, AIDE).
  - Automated alerting and reporting for suspicious activities.

- **Security Audits:**
  - Conducted regular security audits and vulnerability assessments.
  - Implemented security patches and updates.

### 4. Backup and Recovery
- **Backup Processes:**
  - Designed and implemented backup strategies for critical data.
  - Automated backup processes using shell scripts and cron jobs.
  - Managed backup retention policies and storage solutions.

- **Recovery Procedures:**
  - Tested and validated backup and recovery procedures.
  - Ensured data integrity and availability through regular recovery drills.
